# Compare Content In Files

Comparing text content in files for specific regex.

Small program which takes files from specific directory. Then, through regex takes specific text from one file and look for it in the other file.
In this case I am using JSON file and YAML file. I know the basic text structure of the file that's why i know how to create my regex.

- "MyDir" is example that should be changed for the specific file directory
- The Regex patterns could be change as per work need.
